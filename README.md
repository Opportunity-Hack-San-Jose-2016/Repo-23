### Problem Statement - 
I am a case manager and I want to raise funds.
One way I do this is by presenting the success stories in a more engaging manner.
I care the most about convincing potential donors, communicating how it would impact and make the website more user-friendly.
But the problem is that I can't generate engaging content and it takes too much time and it must fit into the existing framework.
So I have to update the website manually to represent new stories.
